                <h3> My professional Career</h3>
                <p>
                In my life I have lived 16 years in Lebanon and 2 in France, where I finished my education. After getting my French baccalaureat I took a gap year for myself to identify what I wanted to do in the futur. I've been through many internships some in the computer and communications domain and some other in the Financial domain and I made my choice to continue a professional career in Financial Advising. Which led me to applying to the prestigeous ESSEC Business School.

                <h3> My countries </h3>
                <p>
                Discover all of the amazing parts of Lebanon and France. The first being a  country nestled in the heart of the Middle East, and the second being the home of the capital of Love and Fashion. From the snow-capped mountains to the crystal-clear waters of the Mediterranean Sea, it's a feast to the eyes in both countries. Their rich histories and vibrant cultures are also reflected in their architectures and cuisine making. Both being truly unique and enchanting.
